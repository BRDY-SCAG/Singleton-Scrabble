This project is a Singleton Scrabble board generator. It generates a unique board and 7 unique tiles for the player to 
begin playing Scrabble. 

I am using the Intellij build system to build this project. 

The first step to Running this Program is to clone the repository. 
From here you need to use IntelliJ to open the project. 
To ensure it will build first try running the ScrabbleTestThreads class (clicking the start button).
If you get some build error make sure that in the Project Structure the Language Level is set to SDK default 

The versyon of SDK i used is Corretto 21 but it should build regardless given it's simplicity.

After this everything should run smoothly.
